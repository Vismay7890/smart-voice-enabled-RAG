# Interactive Chatbot with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

ðŸ¤– Welcome to our interactive chatbot project powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)! This project combines the power of state-of-the-art language models with advanced retrieval techniques to create an engaging and intelligent conversational agent.

## Overview

Our chatbot leverages the RAG framework, which seamlessly integrates retrieval-based and generative approaches to natural language processing. By retrieving relevant context from a large knowledge base and generating responses based on that context, our chatbot provides accurate and contextually rich interactions.

## Features

- **Intelligent Responses:** Our chatbot uses advanced natural language understanding to provide intelligent responses tailored to user queries.
  
- **Contextual Understanding:** By retrieving relevant context from a diverse knowledge base, our chatbot ensures that responses are contextually appropriate and informative.
  
- **Interactive Experience:** Users can engage in interactive conversations with the chatbot, exploring a wide range of topics and receiving helpful information in real-time.

- **Voice Interaction:** Users can interact with the chatbot using voice commands, enabling a hands-free and seamless conversational experience.

## Technologies Used

- **RAG Model:** We utilize the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework, powered by state-of-the-art language models, to generate contextually relevant responses.

- **Python:** The project is implemented in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as PyTorch, Transformers, and Hugging Face's `transformers` library for NLP tasks.

- **Speech Recognition:** We incorporate speech recognition capabilities using the `speech_recognition` library to enable voice interaction with the chatbot.

- **Pygame:** For audio playback functionality, we utilize Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## Getting Started

To start interacting with our chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script (`main.py`) to launch the interactive chatbot interface.
4. Enjoy engaging conversations with our intelligent chatbot!
