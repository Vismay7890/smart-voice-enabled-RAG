Project Title: Intelligent Chatbot with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Overview:
Welcome to our project repository for an intelligent chatbot leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. This innovative project integrates state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a sophisticated conversational agent capable of understanding user queries, retrieving relevant information, and generating human-like responses.

Key Features:
Conversational Intelligence: Our chatbot is designed to engage users in natural language conversations, providing informative and helpful responses across various topics.
RAG Integration: The integration of RAG technology enhances the chatbot's capabilities by allowing it to leverage pre-existing knowledge and external sources to generate contextually relevant responses.
Multi-Modal Input: Users can interact with the chatbot using text input, voice commands, or a combination of both, providing flexibility and convenience in communication.
Dynamic Response Generation: The chatbot dynamically generates responses based on the user's input and the context of the conversation, ensuring personalized and relevant interactions.
Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to gracefully manage unexpected user inputs and maintain the conversational flow without disruption.
Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language used for development, allowing for seamless integration of various NLP libraries and frameworks.
PyTorch: PyTorch is utilized for implementing the RAG model, enabling efficient retrieval and generation of responses.
SpeechRecognition: For handling voice inputs and converting them into text for processing.
Pygame: Used for audio playback functionality, enhancing the user experience by enabling the chatbot to respond audibly.
Installation:
To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure you have the necessary API keys and credentials for any external services used by the chatbot.
Run the main script to start the chatbot application.
Usage:
Once the chatbot is running, users can interact with it through text input or voice commands. Simply type or speak your query, and the chatbot will generate a response based on the input provided. Explore various topics, ask questions, and engage in meaningful conversations with the intelligent chatbot.
